  <h1>My Story</h1>
  <p>
    👶🏻 I was born in Santiago, Chile 🇨🇱 and I'm the youngest of 3 children. I
    grew up playing a lot with my neighbors and siblings. A lot of
    videogames 🕹, a lot of playing fantasy games with toy weapons inventing
    rol stories everyday 🧙🏻‍♂️⚔ and watching a lot of TV shows and movies 📺.

    We got our first computer when I was something about 5 years old 🖥.
    I would use it to play things like Prince of Persia (sucked at it), Jazz
    Rabbit or <a href="http://www.redwoodgames.com/pickle.php">
      Pickle Wars 🥒
    </a>. I got really interested about this machine that could do so much. I
    remember my father telling us the first time he knew about online shopping.
    I was imagining a whole supermarket built in 3D and that you would take
    your items with your avatar in your cart just as it is in real life 🛒...
    well the truth was much different but I didn't find that until some years
    later when we got internet. I learn HTML when I was something like 11 years
    old, with the help of a book my father got for me but I just made local
    websites since I didn't know how to deploy to the internet.

    I was very courious about the world, I wanted to know how it worked. And
    the thing that surprised me the most were computers. How they could put so
    much intelligence in that machine it was like magic for me, how you could
    control characters, explore virtual worlds, calculate things, all coming
    from something made from physical materials like metal and glass. So after
    taking a summer course on Programming (with Java) at Universidad de Chile,
    I was completely decided to study Computer Science.

    I wanted to study at PUC the most selective university of my country and my
    grades were pretty low (played to much MMORPGs in high school 😅) so I
    studied like crazy for the university selection exams. I did great on my
    Science exam but to get directly in the program I wanted I needed something
    like at most 2 errors out of ¿70? questions on the Math exam, so I think
    the pressure was too much, and I didn't make it.
