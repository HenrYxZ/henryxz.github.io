      For my capstone project I've developed a tool for creating interactive 3D
      pictorial maps for storytelling. The maps are of ancient cities and
      they are created using data-driven procedural placement. The idea is to
      show important cities from the Bible so that people can be immersed in
      the story and better understand the context.
