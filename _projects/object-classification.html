  Back at PUC, my home university, I won a Short-Term Research Scholarship to
  travel to Texas A&M University for about 2 months. I worked on Research for
  Agriculture under the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, advised
  by prof. Bruce Gooch. I created an image classification program from scratch
  with Python and OpenCV and using the libraries numpy, scipy and matplotlib.
  The model had an accuracy of 80% with 5 classes using only about 30 testing
  images per class.

  In my last week, I made a prototype feature of voice commands using speech
  recognition for an Android app used in Agriculture research.
