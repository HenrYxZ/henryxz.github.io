      Back at PUC, my home university, I won a Short-Term Research Scholarship to
      travel to Texas A&M University for about 2 months. I worked in Research for
      Agriculture under the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, advised
      by prof. Bruce Gooch. I created an image classification program from scratch
      using Python and OpenCV, and the libraries numpy, scipy and matplotlib.
      The model had an accuracy of 80% with 5 classes using only about 30 testing
      images per class.

      In my last week, I made a prototype feature of voice commands using speech
      recognition for an Android app used in Agriculture research.
