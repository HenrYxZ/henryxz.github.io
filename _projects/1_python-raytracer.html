      Sombra is a Raytracer made with Python for my Image Synthesis class. The
      main purpose of it is to be educational, so I focused on a clean code
      rather than efficiency. You can see the source code on GitHub here:

      It first started with a 2D shader and evolved into a 3D Raytracer, you
      can see the shader here:
