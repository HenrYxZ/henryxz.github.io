      I have been working in a Raytracer for Python for the Image Synthesis class
      and learned a lot of Computer Graphics and 3D Math. It is not efficient, and
      the main purpose is educational. You can see my code on GitHub here:

      It first started with a 2D shader and evolved to a 3D Raytracer, you can see
      the shader here: <a href="https://github.com/HenrYxZ/2d-simple-shader">
