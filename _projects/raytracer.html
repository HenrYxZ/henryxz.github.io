For a computer graphics class we had to implement a Raytracer in groups of 3
people. The image shows the program develop by us. We were given a skeleton
program which included the interface and the generation of windows and debugging
window with the generation of lines for the rays and the camera. We only had to
implement the Phong lighting model, texture mapping and the calculations for
reflections and refractions. We had 2 weeks to do that. The code is in GitHub:
